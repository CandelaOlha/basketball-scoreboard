# 🏀 Basketball scoreboard

## About this project

A couple of weeks ago I started a free Javascript course at [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/), with the aim of reviewing some basic concepts.

This was the first SOLO project of the course. It consisted of developing a scoreboard for a basketball game. Very very simple, but fun!

From now on I will share on my Github account the projects of the course, which will increase in complexity.
